Dentahl (german acronym for "**D**er **e**infache **N**aruto Online **T**eambau **A**ssistent von **H**idden **L**eaf (The simple Naruto Online team building assistend from Hidden Leaf)) is a hobby project to manage different teams and provide a way to share the teams between your friends. 
Because you only have a limited amount of saveable teams in the game this toll gives you the option to save multiple teams either online or local. 
The online storage uses a MySQL database with an PHP access layer which can be hosted on any compatible server. 
At the moment the only supported client language is Java.
